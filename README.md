## organization

This repository is a [monorepo][awesome-monorepo] (not monolith) of my
programs using a
[hybrid approach](https://www.rocketpoweredjetpants.com/2017/11/organising-a-monorepo/#blended-monorepos)
of organization where the first level groups projects under the language
they are primarily written in (e.g., f-sharp, hcl, python) and the
second is the functional area the projects are categorized as (e.g.,
integrations, infrastructure).

```
f-sharp/integrations/TodoistLogseqIntegration/
hcl/infrastructure/frankenstructure
```
